## Presentation of membrane algorithms and their applications

[Here](https://github.com/biancaisc/Membrane-Computing/blob/main/Membrane%20Computing%20Presentation.pptx) is an overview of the membrane algorithms and their applications.

# Proof of Concept
[Here](https://github.com/biancaisc/Membrane-Computing/blob/main/code.py) is a PoC to experimentally study the efficiency of membrane computing algorithms compared to classical SAT problem solving approaches.
